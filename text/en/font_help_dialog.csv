"dlg_font_config_help","As you've probably already noticed, you can set a separate font for game UI, map and overmap. Additionally, each of these three fonts in Cataclysm has three size parameters that define how it is drawn. They can be set in the game under [i]Settings > Graphics > Font Settings[/i].\n\n[IMG_1]\n\n[b]Font Height[/b] and [b]Font Width[/b] define the pixel size of the rectangle reserved for each character. If this rectangle is too small, the letters will be clipped. If it is too large, they will be far apart and appear undersized.\n\n[IMG_2]\n\n[b]Font Size[/b]] is the actual size at which font glyphs will always be rendered, whether they fit into reserved space or not.\n\nFor the default Cataclysm fonts, [i]Terminus[/i] and [i]Unifont[/i], these values have a very simple relationship: Font Height should be the same as Font Size, and Font Width should be half that for UI, and equal to Height for everything else (so that tiles are square).\n\nThese ratios also work for many 3rd party fonts one may decide to use, but for some fonts a bit of tinkering is required to figure out a good-looking combination of font height, width and size.  Fortunately, Dabdoob already knows good size ratios for the fonts it offers, so you only need to specify the desired [b]Font Size[/b], and it will calculate and apply the other two values automatically. They are also applied when you set a custom font in the left pane without changing the size.\n\nIt is also recommended to turn on [b]Font Blending[/b] for smoother font rendering.   "
