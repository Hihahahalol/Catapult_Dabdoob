# Translation Additions

This file documents additional translations that need to be incorporated into the main translation files.

## New Buttons: Check for Updates and Update

The following translations need to be added to the game_tab translation files:

- btn_check=Check for updates
- tooltip_check=Check if there are updates available for the current installation
- btn_update=Update
- tooltip_update=Update the current installation to the latest version

These are temporarily stored in text/en-additions/game_tab_addition.txt until they can be properly incorporated into the binary translation files using the Godot editor.
