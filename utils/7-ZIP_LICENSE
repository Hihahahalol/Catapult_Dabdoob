7-Zip Command Line Version
==========================

This package includes 7-Zip command line binaries for both platforms:
- 7za.exe: Windows (x64) standalone version of 7-Zip
- 7za: Linux (x64) STATIC standalone version of 7-Zip (7zzs)

The Linux binary is the static version (7zzs) which includes all libraries
statically linked. This ensures maximum compatibility across different Linux
distributions without requiring additional system libraries.

Binary Details:
- 7za.exe (Windows): Standalone version, ~587KB
- 7za (Linux): Static version (7zzs), ~3.75MB - larger but fully self-contained

7za (standalone) is a standalone version of 7-Zip. 
7za supports only 7z, lzma, cab, zip, gzip, bzip2, Z and tar formats. 
7za doesn't use external modules.

These binaries provide cross-platform compression and decompression 
functionality with consistent performance on both Windows and Linux.
